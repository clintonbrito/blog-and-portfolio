I'm a Back-End Developer at SouJunior Labs with a passion for technology, programming, and other nerdy stuff.

My professional background is in the financial market and business management. I have a degree in Business Management and I'm currently persuing a Bachalor's in Software Engineering.

I'm also a content creator, currently building my own YouTube channel where I share foundational knowledge for aspiring software developers looking to land their first job in the field.

In my free time, I enjoy staying home to watch movies, TV series, and live sports. I also love traveling and staying active through sports.
