I'm a Software Developer at [Geosite](https://geosite.com.br/) with a passion for technology, programming, and other nerdy stuff.

My professional background is in the financial market and business management. I have a degree in Business Management and I'm currently persuing a Bachalor's in Software Engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy staying home to play videogames, watch movies, TV series, and live sports. I also love traveling and staying active through sports.
