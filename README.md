# My Blog and Portfolio

This is a fork of the [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) template. I have made some modifications to the original template to suit my needs.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a blog and portfolio website that is easy to maintain and customize. I wanted to use Next.js and Tailwind CSS because I have experience with them and I like them. I also wanted to use Contentlayer to manage the content logic. I found the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog template and I thought it was a good starting point. I have made some modifications to the original template to suit my needs.

## Features

- Next.js with Typescript
- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to manage content logic
- Easy styling customization with [Tailwind 3.0](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3) and primary color attribute
- [MDX - write JSX in markdown documents!](https://mdxjs.com/)
- Lightweight and minimal for optimal performance
- Mobile-friendly view
- Light and dark theme
- Font optimization with [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font)
- [Github alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) via [remark-github-blockquote-alert](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/remark-github-blockquote-alert)
- Automatic image optimization via [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
- Support for tags - each unique tag will be its own page
- Support for multiple authors
- 3 different blog layouts
- 2 different blog listing layouts
- Support for nested routing of blog posts
- Projects page
- Preconfigured security headers
- SEO friendly with RSS feed, sitemaps and more!


## Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.

`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card on the projects page.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - tailwind configuration and stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`contentlayer.config.ts` - configuration for Contentlayer, including definition of content sources and MDX plugins used. See [Contentlayer documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) for more information.

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then use them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link, `next/image` component, table of contents component and Newsletter form are passed down. Note that the components should be default exported to avoid [existing issues with Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/51593).

`layouts` - main templates used in pages:

- There are currently 3 post layouts available: `PostLayout`, `PostSimple` and `PostBanner`. `PostLayout` is the default 2 column layout with meta and author information. `PostSimple` is a simplified version of `PostLayout`, while `PostBanner` features a banner image.
- There are 2 blog listing layouts: `ListLayout`, the layout used in version 1 of the template with a search bar and `ListLayoutWithTags`, currently used in version 2, which omits the search bar but includes a sidebar with information on the tags.

`app` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) for more information.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.

## Post

Content is modelled using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), which allows you to define your own content schema and use it to generate typed content objects. See [Contentlayer documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) for more information.

### Frontmatter
